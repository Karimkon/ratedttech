                            <h1 class="mb-3 text-secondary text-uppercase font-weight-bold">Fiber optic cables</h1>
                            <h6>Fiber optic cables are wires made of glass or plastic that are used to transmit information as light signals over long distances. They work by transmitting light through the core of the cable, which is surrounded by a cladding material that keeps the light confined within the core.

                                In terms of speed, fiber optic cables are much faster than traditional copper cables. They can transmit data at speeds of up to 100 gigabits per second, which is much faster than the maximum speeds achievable with copper cables. This makes fiber optic cables ideal for high-speed data transfer, such as video streaming and online gaming.</h6>
                            <h6>There are several advantages of fiber optic cables:
                                <ul>
                                <li> Fiber optic cables offer faster data transfer speeds than traditional copper cables, which makes them ideal for high-bandwidth applications.</li>
                                
                                <li> Reliability: Fiber optic cables are less susceptible to interference and signal degradation than copper cables, which makes them more reliable for data transmission.</li>
                                
                                <li>Durability: Fiber optic cables are made of glass or plastic, which makes them more durable and resistant to physical damage than copper cables.</li>
                                
                                <li>Immunity to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI): Fiber optic cables are not affected by electromagnetic interference, which makes them ideal for use in environments where EMI is a concern.</li>
                                
                                <li>Security: Fiber optic cables are more secure than copper cables, as it is difficult to tap into or interfere with a fiber optic signal.</li>
                                
                                <li>Bandwidth: Fiber optic cables offer much greater bandwidth than copper cables, which means that they can support much higher data transfer rates.</li>
                            </ul>
                                In conclusion, fiber optic cables offer numerous advantages over traditional copper cables, including faster speeds, greater reliability, and greater resistance to interference. They are the preferred choice for high-speed data transfer and are widely used in telecommunications, the internet, and other industries.</h6>
